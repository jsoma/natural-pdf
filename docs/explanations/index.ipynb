    "# PDF Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "This section goes beyond \"how-to\" guides to explain the deeper aspects of PDF processing and challenging scenarios you might encounter. These explanations help you understand why certain approaches work better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "### [PDF Extraction Challenges](pdf-extraction-challenges.md)\n",
    "Why PDFs are hard to extract from and strategies for handling common problems like jumbled text order, mixed columns, corrupted fonts, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Understanding Fonts in PDFs](pdf-fonts.md)\n",
    "A deep dive into how fonts work in PDFs, what those strange font names like \"ABCDEF+Arial\" mean, and how to handle font-related extraction issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [OCR Challenges and Solutions](ocr-challenges.md)\n",
    "The ins and outs of Optical Character Recognition, comparing OCR engines, and techniques for getting better results from problematic documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Approaching PDF Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start simple, then add complexity**: Try the basic approaches before diving into complex solutions\n",
    "2. **Visualize, don't guess**: Use `highlight()` and `to_image()` to see what's happening\n",
    "3. **Mix and match methods**: Combine different extraction techniques for better results\n",
    "4. **Test on samples**: PDF extraction methods that work well on one document might fail on another\n",
    "5. **Know when to use OCR**: Sometimes OCR is necessary even when PDFs appear to have text\n",
